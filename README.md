## 🌱 Crops & Farming

Grow your own ingredients! Four new crops can be discovered by breaking grass:

- 🍅 **Tomato Plant** — drops fresh Tomatoes
- 🥒 **Cucumber Plant** — for that extra crunch
- 🧅 **Onion Plant** — because every burger needs one
- 🌿 **Mustard Plant** — grow your own condiments

> 💡 Seeds drop randomly **(10% chance)** when breaking **Grass, Tall Grass, Ferns or Large Ferns** — just like real-life foraging!

---

## 🛠️ Tools

- 🍳 **Spatula** — the essential burger-flipping tool, used as a crafting ingredient
- 🔪 **Knife** — a durable iron knife for food preparation. Works as a **crafting remainder** — loses durability with each use!

---

## ⛏️ World Generation

- **Salt Ore** — spawns underground in stone layers. Mine it to obtain Salt for seasoning your fries!

---

## 🍳 Frying Station

The heart of the mod! The **Frying Station** works like a furnace but uses **custom frying recipes**.

- Toss in raw fries, add some fuel, and get perfectly fried results
- The block **lights up** when active
- Works with hoppers for automation
